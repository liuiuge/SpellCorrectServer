genesis 1

1 	in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth  
2	and the earth was without form  and void  and darkness  was  upon the face of the deep  and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters  
3 	and god said  let there be light  and there was light  
4	and god saw the light  that  it was  good  and god divided the light from the darkness  
5	and god called the light day  and the darkness he called night  and the evening and the morning were the first day  
6 	and god said  let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters  and let it divide the waters from the waters  
7	and god made the firmament  and divided the waters which  were  under the firmament from the waters which  were  above the firmament  and it was so  
8	and god called the firmament heaven  and the evening and the morning were the second day  
9 	and god said  let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place  and let the dry  land  appear  and it was so  
10	and god called the dry  land  earth  and the gathering together of the waters called he seas  and god saw that  it was  good  
11	and god said  let the earth bring forth grass  the herb yielding seed   and  the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind  whose seed  is  in itself  upon the earth  and it was so  
12	and the earth brought forth grass   and  herb yielding seed after his kind  and the tree yielding fruit  whose seed  was  in itself  after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good  
13	and the evening and the morning were the third day  
14 	and god said  let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night  and let them be for signs  and for seasons  and for days  and years  
15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth  and it was so  
16	and god made two great lights  the greater light to rule the day  and the lesser light to rule the night   he made  the stars also  
17	and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth  
18	and to rule over the day and over the night  and to divide the light from the darkness  and god saw that  it was  good  
19	and the evening and the morning were the fourth day  
20 	and god said  let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life  and fowl  that  may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven  
21	and god created great whales  and every living creature that moveth  which the waters brought forth abundantly  after their kind  and every winged fowl after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good  
22	and god blessed them  saying  be fruitful  and multiply  and fill the waters in the seas  and let fowl multiply in the earth  
23	and the evening and the morning were the fifth day  
24 	and god said  let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind  cattle  and creeping thing  and beast of the earth after his kind  and it was so  
25	and god made the beast of the earth after his kind  and cattle after their kind  and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind  and god saw that  it was  good  
26 	and god said  let us make man in our image  after our likeness  and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea  and over the fowl of the air  and over the cattle  and over all the earth  and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth  
27	so god created man in his  own  image  in the image of god created he him  male and female created he them  
28	and god blessed them  and god said unto them  be fruitful  and multiply  and replenish the earth  and subdue it  and have dominion over the fish of the sea  and over the fowl of the air  and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth  
29 	and god said  behold  i have given you every herb bearing seed  which  is  upon the face of all the earth  and every tree  in the which  is  the fruit of a tree yielding seed  to you it shall be for meat  
30	and to every beast of the earth  and to every fowl of the air  and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth  wherein  there is  life   i have given  every green herb for meat  and it was so  
31 	and god saw every thing that he had made  and  behold   it was  very good  and the evening and the morning were the sixth day  

genesis 2

1 	thus the heavens and the earth were finished  and all the host of them  
2	and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made  and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made  
3	and god blessed the seventh day  and sanctified it  because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made  
4 	these  are  the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created  in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens  
5	and every plant of the field before it was in the earth  and every herb of the field before it grew  for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth  and  there was  not a man to till the ground  
6	but there went up a mist from the earth  and watered the whole face of the ground  
7	and the lord god formed man  of  the dust of the ground  and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life  and man became a living soul  
8 	and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden  and there he put the man whom he had formed  
9	and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight  and good for food  the tree of life also in the midst of the garden  and the tree of knowledge of good and evil  
10	and a river went out of eden to water the garden  and from thence it was parted  and became into four heads  
11	the name of the first  is  pison  that  is  it which compasseth the whole land of havilah  where  there is  gold  
12	and the gold of that land  is  good  there  is  bdellium and the onyx stone  
13	and the name of the second river  is  gihon  the same  is  it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia  
14	and the name of the third river  is  hiddekel  that  is  it which goeth toward the east of assyria  and the fourth river  is  euphrates  
15	and the lord god took the man  and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it  
16 	and the lord god commanded the man  saying  of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat  
17	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  thou shalt not eat of it  for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die  
18 	and the lord god said   it is  not good that the man should be alone  i will make him an help meet for him  
19	and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field  and every fowl of the air  and brought  them  unto adam to see what he would call them  and whatsoever adam called every living creature  that  was  the name thereof  
20	and adam gave names to all cattle  and to the fowl of the air  and to every beast of the field  but for adam there was not found an help meet for him  
21 	and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam  and he slept  and he took one of his ribs  and closed up the flesh instead thereof  
22	and the rib  which the lord god had taken from man  made he a woman  and brought her unto the man  
23	and adam said  this  is  now bone of my bones  and flesh of my flesh  she shall be called woman  because she was taken out of man  
24	therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother  and shall cleave unto his wife  and they shall be one flesh  
25	and they were both naked  the man and his wife  and were not ashamed  
genesis 3
1 	now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made  and he said unto the woman  yea  hath god said  ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden  
2	and the woman said unto the serpent  we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden  
3	but of the fruit of the tree which  is  in the midst of the garden  god hath said  ye shall not eat of it  neither shall ye touch it  lest ye die  
4	and the serpent said unto the woman  ye shall not surely die  
5	for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof  then your eyes shall be opened  a
